<h2>Research Interests</h2>

My interests broadly lie at the intersection of Deep Learning and Physics. More specifically, I am interested in improving and accelerating Molecular Simulation with the help of Deep Learning Interatomic Potentials. A core focus has been on the role of symmetry in these potentials. More recently, my interests have focused on scalability of these methods and their generalization to out-of-distribution data.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a third-year PhD student at Harvard University, fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://bkoz.seas.harvard.edu/">Boris Kozinsky</a>.<br><br>Prior to joining Harvard, I obtained a Master's from MIT, where I worked with Alexie Kolpak and Boris Kozinsky. At MIT, I also wrote a thesis on equivariant neural networks. Before that, I spent a year in Los Angeles, working on the NASA mission <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/index.html">SOFIA</a>, where I wrote software for analyzing telescope data and used ML to model the dynamics of piezolelectrics. I obtained my Bachelor's from the University of Stuttgart, Germany. I am originally from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illertissen">small, but beautiful town a few minutes from the Bavarian Alps</a>.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>We have developed an open-source software for building equivariant interatomic potentials, called NequIP. The code is integrated with the Molecular Dynamics software LAMMPS as well as ASE. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/mir-group/nequip"> Github</a>. It is under the MIT License. If you have questions, please don't hesitate to email me (see above). </p>
