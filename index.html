<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind in San Francisco. Before joining Google, I obtained my PhD from Harvard, during which I spent four years in the group of Boris Kozinsky and seven months working with Ekin Dogus Cubuk at Google Brain. I am originally from a small, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illertissen">but beautiful</a> town a few minutes from the Bavarian Alps.</p> 

<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 05/2023: <a href=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2373022-watch-44-million-atoms-simulated-using-ai-and-a-supercomputer/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=echobox&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1684235383> New Scientist covered</a> our work on large-scale biomolecular dynamics. 
  <li> 04/2023: <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10061.pdf> The final paper from my PhD is now public.</a> We show how the state-of-the-art accuracy of Allegro can be scaled to large biomolecular systems, up to the all-atom, fully solvated HIV capsid at 44 million atoms. We include strong and weak scaling results on a large pretrained Allegro potential and show top speeds of >100 steps/second on large biomolecular systems.

<h2>Software</h2>
During my PhD I published two codes for the NequIP and Allegro potential. Both are public on my PhD group's Github. If you have questions, please reach out to the current developers on the GitHub, they are happy to help: 

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/mir-group/nequip"> NequIP</a>, MIT license </li>
  <li> <a href="https://github.com/mir-group/allegro"> Allegro</a>, MIT license </li>
</ul>

Both of these also come with a LAMMPS pair_style, written by my brilliant former labmate Anders Johansson, which can be found here: 

<ul>
